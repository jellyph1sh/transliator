♫Manage the landing♪

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,700
♫ I am super Ready , I quickly have ♪

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,060
♫ The Weapon that everyone wants ♫

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,180
♫ I kill you quietly, you're shabby ♫

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,700
♫ I see your trap stuck to the ceiling ♫

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,120
♫ Dude, you're going to do in your pants ♫

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,460
I see you in the distance, you remain static

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,460
I'm going to shoot you in the head, so I'm going to ...

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,420
I manage my 1vs1 easily

10
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,680
Back to reality

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,980
I'm not Gotaga, I'm squeezie

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,480
and this guy on a distant roof

13
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,240
who snipe and has a big killfeed

14
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,100
and this player who camps in the toilet

15
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,100
Who drinks his shield potion

16
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,340
And this unpleasant feeling

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,940
to be late in the storm

18
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,160
and those black thoughts that are going through you

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,160
when you lose to the opposing player

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,460
I watch Stream to train

21
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,460
But I remain a nil player

22
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,880
at each game my name is Bambi

23
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,880
Easy to kill, like squeezie

24
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,240
*Refrain :I wanted to make top 1

25
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,240
*without the help of any buddy*

26
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,400
*without the power of a fairground*

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,220
*Neither the charisma of a villain*

28
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,220
I wanted to make top 1

29
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,460
without the help of any buddy

30
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,920
without the power of a fairground

31
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,920
Neither the charisma of a villain

32
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,600
I did shit, I'm scornful

33
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,500
He killed me even though he is ten years old

34
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,140
I still miss component

35
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,420
I build so slowly that it's exhausting

36
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,420
I made stairs, I put my springboard

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,840
I enjoyed it . he broke the base

38
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Days to try the top 1 without prone

39
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,200
I do a beautiful thing. on the network I share it

40
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,860
I'm dragging on the map

41
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,860
to every enemy I panic

42
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,920
I sweat to ball

43
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,900
I will be better on the titanic

44
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,900
I drink a big potion before the little potion

45
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,640
I put a campfire, while I have a medikit

46
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,800
I am aiming at the lamppost instead of the guy

47
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,020
I break all the walls to find the chest

48
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,460
Every time I get one shot at the shotgun

49
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,820
if there is a beautiful skin in the shop.
I missed an offer

50
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,720
I watch Stream to train

51
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,720
But I remain a nil player

52
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,200
at each game my name is Bambi

53
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,440
Easy to kill, like squeezie

54
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,560
*REFRAIN*

55
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,280
I want to make top 1 me

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,280
I want to make top 1 me

57
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,820
I want to make top 1 me

58
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
I want to make top 1 me

59
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,780
I want to make top 1 me

60
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,180
I want to make top 1 me
